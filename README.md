# Diagonal structured covariance matrix using lme4::modular
Implements a diagonal random effects covariance matrix using `lme4` and compares results with `glmmTMB`.

### Observation

1.Diagonal covariance structure for random effects.

2.Fixed effects match between `lme4` and `glmmTMB`.

3.Random effects standard deviations are consistent.
